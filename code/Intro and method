Numerous studies have examined the connection between playing violent video games and
acting aggressively, particularly in regard to young people’s increased video game consumption.
While some studies believe that playing violent video games might be a harmless way to
relieve stress, others claim that it can actually increase violence. This dataset was collected
in Pakistan in order to study the relationship between gamers’ interactions with video games
and how such interactions affect their aggressive behavior. The purpose of this analysis is to
find trends or correlations that can provide insight into whether playing violent video games
is a good indicator of violence. Our analysis’s research question is: Do age groups and video
game playing time have an impact on a player’s level of aggression? The study we conducted
is based on the hypothesis 𝐻0 ∶ Age groups and the amount of time spent playing video games
do not significantly affect BPAQ scores. 𝐻0 ∶ 𝛼𝛽11 = 𝛼𝛽12 = ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ = 𝛼𝛽35 = 0. 𝐻1 ∶ Age groups
and the amount of time spent playing video games have a substantial impact on BPAQ scores.
𝐻1 ∶ 𝛼𝛽𝑖𝑗 ≠ 0 where i (age_group) = 1,2,3 and j (hours_of_playing) = 1,2,3,4,5

This dataset includes a total of 147 observations and 43 variables out of which 1 variable is for
timestamp, 5 questions are the background questions including name, age, gender, city, type
of family (nuclear,joint), favorite type of game, favorite game, Hours spent on playing and 33
other behavioral questions. The questions were answered in the format of likert scale (“Strongly
disagree”,“Disagree”,“Neither agree nor disagree”,“Strongly agree”,“Agree”) so they were con-
verted into numeric value of (“1”,“2”,“3”,“4”,“5”) and hours of playing were initially answered
as (“less than 1 hour”,“more than 1 hour”,“more than 2 hour”,“more than 3 hour”,“more than
5 hour”) and they were converted into numeric value of (“1”,“2”,“3”,“4”,“5”). A new variable
was added in dataset names as BPAQ Score and it stores the total count of questions that were
answered. The higher number shows the higher effect on behavior (aggression) after playing
video games. The dataset analyzes the correlation between video game play and aggression
in people between the ages of 15 and 32. The main goal is to determine whether aggression
scores are affected by age group and video game playing hours. Once preprocessing has been
completed (data cleaning, encoding, BPAQ score), the analysis was further proceeded by data
visualizations (box plots and histograms for hours of playing and age groups, interaction plot)
, two-way ANOVA for fixed effects (for interaction between age groups and hours of playing,
assumptions checked (plots, leveneTest and Shapiro-Wilk Test) and then Post-Hoc Analysis
(Tukey pairwise comparisons).
